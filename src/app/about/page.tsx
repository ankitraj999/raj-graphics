            <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
              <p>
                My passion for design began at an early age, drawing and sketching whenever I could. This creative spark
                led me to pursue formal education in graphic design, where I honed my skills and developed a deep
                understanding of design principles.
              </p>
              <p>
                After graduating, I started my professional journey at a boutique design agency, where I had the
                opportunity to work with diverse clients across various industries. This experience was invaluable,
                teaching me not only technical skills but also how to translate client needs into effective visual
                solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with brands of all sizes, from startups to established
                corporations. Each project has been a unique challenge, pushing me to innovate and refine my craft. My
                approach combines creativity with strategic thinking, ensuring that every design not only captures
                attention but also communicates the right message to the right audience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, with 25 years of experience behind me, I continue to be passionate about creating designs that
                make a difference. I believe that great design has the power to transform businesses, and I'm committed
                to helping my clients achieve their goals through thoughtful, impactful visual communication.
